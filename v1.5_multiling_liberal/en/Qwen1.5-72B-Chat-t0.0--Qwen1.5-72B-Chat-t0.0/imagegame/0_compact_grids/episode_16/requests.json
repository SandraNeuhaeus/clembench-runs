Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\nT ▢ ▢ ▢ T\nT T ▢ T T\nT ▢ T ▢ T\nT ▢ T ▢ T\nT ▢ T ▢ T\n\nWhat is your next command?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the first row, first column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the first row, fifth column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the second row, second column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the second row, fourth column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the third row, third column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the fourth row, second column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the fourth row, fourth column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the fifth row, first column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put a T in the fifth row, third column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: DONE<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-08-01 11:23:16.878284", "call_duration": "0:00:00.863396", "response": "Command: DONE", "model_name": "Qwen1.5-72B-Chat"}}}]
