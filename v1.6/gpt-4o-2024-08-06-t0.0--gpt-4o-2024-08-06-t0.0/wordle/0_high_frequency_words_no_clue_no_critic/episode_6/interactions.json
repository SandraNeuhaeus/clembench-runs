You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:39:10.170194", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: \"Crane\" is a common five-letter English word that contains a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels, which can help identify correct letters and their positions."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:39:10.170202", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "\"Crane\" is a common five-letter English word that contains a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels, which can help identify correct letters and their positions."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:39:10.170241", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = field\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4o-2024-08-06)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "\"Crane\" is a common five-letter English word that contains a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels, which can help identify correct letters and their positions.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:39:11.526587", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:39:11.526711", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: slope  \nexplanation: Based on the feedback, \"c\", \"r\", \"a\", and \"n\" are incorrect, so they should not be in the next guess.
