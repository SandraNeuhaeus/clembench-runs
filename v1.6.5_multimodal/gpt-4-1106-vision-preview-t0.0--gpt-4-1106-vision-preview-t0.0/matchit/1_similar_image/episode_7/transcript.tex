	 ANSWER: The lighting in my image creates soft shadows on the elephants and the ground, suggesting an indirect source of light, such as the sun at dawn or dusk. However, the sun itself is not visible in the image; the light appears diffused, possibly due to atmospheric conditions like mist or dust.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
