	 DESCRIPTION: The image depicts a moment from a baseball game at night. A batter, wearing a white uniform with a visible number 10, is in the midst of a swing, watching the ball that is in motion towards the right side of the frame. The catcher, wearing dark gear, and the umpire, in black, are crouched behind the batter. The scene is captured from the side, providing a clear view of the batter's profile and the action. The field is illuminated by stadium lights, and the background is out of focus, emphasizing the players in the foreground.
