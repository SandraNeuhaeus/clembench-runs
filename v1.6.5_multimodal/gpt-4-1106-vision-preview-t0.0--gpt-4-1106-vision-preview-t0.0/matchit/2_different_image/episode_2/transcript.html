        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image shows a city street view leading towards a classical building with a prominent dome and a statue on top. The architecture suggests a historical or government building. There is a mix of modern and older buildings, with a modern high-rise visible to the left. The street is busy with cars, and there is a yellow double-decker bus in front of the building. The lighting suggests it is either dawn or dusk.</p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image shows a baseball game in action. A batter wearing a white uniform with red accents and the number 11 is swinging a bat at an incoming baseball. A catcher in a black uniform with red accents is crouched behind him, wearing a catcher&#x27;s mask and holding a catcher&#x27;s mitt where the ball is headed. An umpire in black stands behind the catcher. The scene takes place on a baseball field with green grass in the background and a visible section of the audience. The number 335 is visible on a wall in the background, likely indicating the distance to the outfield wall in feet.</p>
