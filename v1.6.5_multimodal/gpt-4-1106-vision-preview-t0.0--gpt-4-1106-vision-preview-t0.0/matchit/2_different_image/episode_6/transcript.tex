The person on the left is wearing glasses and a backpack, looking to the side. The person in the middle is walking towards the camera with a neutral expression, wearing a sweatshirt with the word "FUBU" on it. The person on the right is looking down at something in their hands. In the background, there are signs for a casino, and the words "St. John" are visible on a hanging sign. There are also various other signs and banners, and the architecture suggests an urban setting with multiple stories.
