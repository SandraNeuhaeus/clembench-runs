There is a woman in a purple jacket walking in front of the stall, and another woman in a red apron behind the stall, seemingly arranging or selecting vegetables. The stall is filled with various vegetables, including bunches of green leafy vegetables, potatoes, and what appears to be ginger. There are also bananas hanging above the stall and boxes labeled "CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES" visible. The setting appears to be in a street market with other stalls or shops in the background.
